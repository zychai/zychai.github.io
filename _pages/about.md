## üì∑ Research and development of acquisition and recognition system for car driver's driving behavior
- 2022.11-2023.10, <u>Project leader</u>, Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Southeast University
- **Abstract:** Accurate and convenient acquisition and identification of driver acceleration and deceleration behavior is an important basis for research on high-carbon driving behavior modification. Existing studies mainly assess drivers' acceleration and deceleration behaviors indirectly through vehicle motion indicators, and collect them through vehicle self-diagnosis systems or other traditional on-board equipment, which have shortcomings such as indirect behavior characterization, low sampling frequency, and poor generality. To solve this problem, this project takes the pedal opening and changing speed as the evaluation index of driver acceleration and deceleration behavior, and designs a method of pedal opening acquisition and recognition based on machine vision. By shooting the side video of the pedal, algorithms such as Hough transform and random sample consistency were used to extract and identify the opening of the pedal, and low-pass filtering was used to remove noise (‚â•1HZ). The sampling frequency of this method is 60Hz, the signal energy loss rate is less than 0.1%, and the acquisition equipment is easy to install and carry. The research results can provide strong basic data support for behavior analysis, low-carbon transportation, driving safety and other research fields.
- **Personal Work**

  - Follow the car experiment, collect experimental data (video)
  - Based on machine vision, detect and extract the rotation opening of the car pedal
  - Design the driver's behavior identification index of lane change, acceleration and deceleration, and judge the driver's driving behavior
  - Multi-source data fusion
  - Project division and coordination, schedule arrangement, group organization and record, preparation of various materials and defense
